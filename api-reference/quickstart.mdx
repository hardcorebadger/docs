## Register a Device

To send push notifications, you need to register each user's device. Here's how to do it:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.push.com/v1/devices/{userId}/{deviceIdentifier} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "deviceToken": "device_token_here",
    "platform": "ios"
  }'
```

<Note>
  The `platform` field can be one of: `ios`, `android`, or `web`
</Note>

## Set Up Preferences

You can set up notification preferences at both the user and device level:

### User Preferences

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.push.com/v1/users/{userId}/preferences \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enabled": true,
    "categories": {
      "marketing": true,
      "security": true,
      "transaction": false
    }
  }'
```

### Device Preferences

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.push.com/v1/devices/{userId}/{deviceIdentifier}/preferences \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "enabled": true,
    "categories": {
      "marketing": true,
      "security": true,
      "transaction": false
    }
  }'
```

## Send Your First Push

Now that you've registered a device, you can send your first push notification:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.push.com/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user123",
    "title": "Hello!",
    "body": "This is your first push notification",
    "platform": "ios",
    "category": "marketing"
  }'
```

## Check Message Status

You can check the status of your messages:

```bash
# List all messages
curl -X GET https://api.push.com/v1/messages?userId=user123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get specific message
curl -X GET https://api.push.com/v1/messages/{messageId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
