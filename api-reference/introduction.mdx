## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. Store it in environment variables or secure configuration management systems.
</Note>

## API Structure

The Push API is organized into several key areas:

- **Devices**: Register and manage user devices
- **Messages**: Send and track push notifications
- **Preferences**: Manage notification settings
- **Webhooks**: Configure delivery tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Device Registration**
   - Register devices as soon as users log in
   - Update device tokens when they change
   - Handle multiple devices per user

2. **Message Sending**
   - Keep messages concise and actionable
   - Use categories for better organization
   - Test notifications on all platforms

3. **User Experience**
   - Respect user preferences
   - Provide clear opt-in/opt-out options
   - Send notifications at appropriate times

## Rate Limits

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- 100 requests per minute for device registration
- 1000 requests per minute for sending messages
- 100 requests per minute for preference updates

<Note>
  Contact support if you need higher rate limits for your use case.
